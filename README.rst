*********
score.dom
*********

.. _js_dom:

This module provides a convenient wrapper for DOM nodes. Its API resembles that
of jQuery, since this has become the best known DOM manipulation API over time.

Quickstart
==========

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="score.init.js"></script>
    <script src="score.dom.js"></script>
    <script>
        (function() {
            var romans = score.dom('.roman');
            score.dom('.home').append(romans);
        })();
    </script>

Details
=======

Constructor
-----------

The "constructor" [1]_ will return an object deriving from ``score.dom.proto``.
It accepts either of the following:

- *Nothing*: Creates an empty node list.
  
.. code-block:: javascript

      score.dom()

- Selector: Selects all nodes matching the selector globally

.. code-block:: javascript

      score.dom('body')

- NodeList object:

.. code-block:: javascript

      score.dom(document.getElementsByTagName('a'))

- A ``score.dom`` object:

.. code-block:: javascript

      var bodyNode = score.dom('body');
      score.dom(bodyNode).addClass('foo');


.. [1] The term *constructor* is actually incorrect, as ``score.dom`` is just a
       normal function.

CSS Class Manipulation
----------------------

The module allows adding/removing css classes using the usual method names:

.. code-block:: javascript

    if (score.dom('body').hasClass('spam')) {
        score.dom('.knight').addClass('ni');
        score.dom('#cheese-shop').removeClass('cheese');
        score.dom('.self-defense').toggleClass('fruit');
    }

DOM restructuring
-----------------

You can remove nodes from the DOM using ``detach()``, and attach them beneath
another given node using ``prepend()`` or ``append()``, depending on whether
they should be inserted at the beginning, or the end of the children list:

.. code-block:: javascript

    score.dom('.parrot').detach();
    score.dom('.fruits').append(score.dom.fromString('<li>Banana</li>'));
    score.dom('.fruits').prepend(score.dom.fromString('<li>Carrot</li>'));
    score.dom('.fruits').children().eq(0).text() // 'Carrot'
